# Dotfiles
My dotfiles, now 10% less jank!

People are actually looking at this. Wot. I made this public out of laziness, so there's a fair bit of jank here.

## Installation

The install script is kinda broken, I need to fix this *at some point*.

## Credits

- Emacs config is based on [Emacs prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
- [ADI1090x's amazing rofi menus](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)
- XMonad and Taffybar configs cobbled together from... a lot of people. I dont actually know haskell.
